/**
 * BUBBLE_SORT sorting algorithm
 * 
 * This class implements the BUBBLE_SORT sorting algorithm, using a SINGLETON
 * pattern to ensure that there is always only one and one instance of this
 * algoritm.
 * 
 * This is possible, as the algorithm is implemented as a "sorting filter" that
 * holds no state regarding the sorting operation -- i.e. receives the data, as
 * parameters, returning the resultig result.
